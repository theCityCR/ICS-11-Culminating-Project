# Focusfy

### Alex Zhu, Raymond Ouyang, Sean Zhao

#### Short Description
Our plan is to create a web-based program that helps teachers and students with productivity. This program includes:
* a customizable schedule
* a to-do list
* digital flashcards //Maybe
* focus timer

#### Technology
We plan on using Intellij and Eclipse for Java, and Webstorm for Javascript, HTML and CSS. We also plan on using GitHub to share our code and make it easy to work remotely

#### Detailed Plan
There are many things this program can do. This program has a scheduling and general productivity app. This app will have three features. The first is a scheduling feature. This schedule can help students and teachers keep track of their school and personal schedules, as well as remind users when the event is almost happening. 

The second is a to-do list. The to-do list is where users can add tasks such as homework and tests onto the list. This will help students keep track of their tasks and will also remind them to do their work. 

The final feature that we plan to add is to add a focus timer. This timer will start counting down for a certain amount of time, where students will focus for that amount of time. After the timer runs out, there will be a certain amount of time for a break. After that, the timer continues. This concept has shown to boost the productivity of many students, and can help with managing time effectively. More features might be added at a later time.
